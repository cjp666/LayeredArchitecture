# Layered Architecture

#### Notes are all currently in rough form, application is working but is a work in progress

Reference architecture similar to what we use in work and a base for future projects

You will need the "simple" database and the script to create this is in the OtherBits folder, the applications connection string is held in the userConnectionStrings.config file

The application is currently hosted in IIS but could easily be hosted in OWIN.  When runs it shows a HTML page that just says "Move along..." but the WebAPI is accessible along the lines of /api/company, this will return a list of all the companies in the “simple” database it uses

# The Layers
## Infrastructure

This is the actual database access, using Entity Framework as ORM.  This is also where the concrete implementations for the repositories reside

Should you decide on a different ORM or database system then this is the layer to be swapped out

## Domain

This is where the domain model lives that is mapped to the actual database by the infrastructure layer.  The interfaces for the repositories are held in this layer

## Application
This is where the application logic and data transfer object reside
The architecture uses DTO's for transfering data to the client rather than the entities themselves so that more lightweight objects are transferred over the wire

## Web Services
Sets up the DI (using Autofac)

Holds the WebAPI which is just a very thin facade to the application layer
