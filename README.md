# LayeredArchitecture

Reference architecture similar to what we use in work and a base for future projects

You will need the "simple" database and the script to create this is in the OtherBits folder, the applications connection string is held in the userConnectionStrings.config file

The application runs and shows a HTML page that just says "Move along..." but the WebAPI is accessible along the lines of /api/company, this will return a list of all the companies in the “simple” database it uses
